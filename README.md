# DMDString and Unit Test
This is my own implementation of a string class. I created this as the std::string was 
not comparing strings like I wanted to for a project. Thus, I just did my own simple 
string class with boolean operators I could manipulate. I also added a unit test as 
it seemed like the perfect project to do one on. I don't endorse using this class on 
anything serious, it lacks features that std::string provides in order to be minimal.

## Notes:
* Straight-forward code, not much to explain. Just add files to your project.

## TODO:
- [ ] Add more features to the string class.
- [ ] Refine the unit test.
- [ ] Add more items to the dmd namespace (particularity a binary tree).
